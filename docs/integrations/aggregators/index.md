# Financial Data Aggregators

Financial data aggregators are services or platforms that collect, normalize, and provide access to financial data from multiple sources, such as banks, credit card companies, investment accounts, and other financial institutions. They play a crucial role in enabling users and businesses to view and manage their financial information in one place.

- **Transaction Normalization:** Standardizes transaction data across different institutions.
- **Data Enrichment:** Adds context to raw data, such as categorizing transactions or identifying merchants.
- **APIs:** Provides programmatic access to aggregated data for developers and businesses.
- **Security:** Implements strong authentication and encryption to protect sensitive financial information.
