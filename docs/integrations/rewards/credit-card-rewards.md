# Credit Card Rewards Integration

MoneyRegrets supports tracking credit card reward programs so you can maximize your points, miles, and cashback earnings.

## What Is This?
Credit card rewards integration allows you to:
- View your current points, miles, or cashback balances
- Track rewards earned from recent transactions
- See upcoming or expiring rewards
- Get insights on how to optimize your spending for more rewards

- Airline and hotel co-branded cards (Delta SkyMiles, United MileagePlus, Marriott Bonvoy, etc.)
- Cashback programs (Discover, Citi Double Cash, etc.)

## How It Works
- Connect your credit card accounts via supported data aggregators (Plaid, Yodlee, etc.)
- Authorize access to your rewards portal (where available)
- MoneyRegrets will periodically sync your rewards balances and display them in your dashboard

## Privacy & Security
- Your login credentials are never stored by MoneyRegrets
- All data is encrypted and read-only
