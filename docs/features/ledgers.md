# Ledger vs Journal

## Journal
- The journal is the book of original entry.
- Every financial transaction is first recorded in the journal as a journal entry, in chronological order.
- Each journal entry includes the date, accounts affected, amounts, and a brief description.
- Journal entries use the double-entry system (debits and credits).
- The journal provides a complete, time-ordered record of all business transactions.

## Ledger
- The ledger is the book of final entry.
- After transactions are recorded in the journal, they are posted (transferred) to the ledger.
- The ledger organizes transactions by account (e.g., Cash, Accounts Receivable, Revenue, etc.).
- Each account in the ledger shows the cumulative balance and all changes over time.
- The ledger is used to prepare financial statements and track account balances.
