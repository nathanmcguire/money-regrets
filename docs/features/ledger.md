# Ledger

An account ledger is the account-specific aggregation of all journal entries affecting that account, with a running balance.

The general ledger is the complete record of all financial transactions combining the account ledgers for every account. It provides a comprehensive view of all debits and credits, enabling accurate financial reporting and reconciliation across the entire system.

## üèóÔ∏è Suggested View: ledger_entries
You can generate this via SQL or ORM as a derived view.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT
  a.id AS account_id,
  a.name AS account_name,
  j.date,
  j.description,
  e.amount,
  e.entry_type,
  CASE 
    WHEN e.entry_type = 'debit' THEN e.amount
    ELSE -e.amount
  END * CASE
    WHEN a.type IN ('asset', 'expense') THEN 1
    ELSE -1
  END AS impact,
  SUM(...) OVER (PARTITION BY a.id ORDER BY j.date, j.id) AS running_balance,
  j.id AS journal_transaction_id
FROM
  journal_entries e
JOIN
  journal_transactions j ON e.journal_transaction_id = j.id
JOIN
  accounts a ON e.account_id = a.id
ORDER BY
  a.id, j.date;

üìä What Can You Do With the Ledger?
Show per-account statements (like your bank does)

Calculate net worth (total assets ‚Äì total liabilities)

Track budget variance against actuals

Reconcile imported vs. journaled transactions

Provide drilldowns from summary charts into ledger lines

üí° Optional Enhancement
Create a materialized view or a cached table like:

sql
Copy
Edit
ledger_snapshots (
  account_id,
  date,
  balance
)
To make balance lookups fast for reports, dashboards, and net worth tracking without recalculating live.
