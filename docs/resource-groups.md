# Resource Groups in Money Regrets

In Money Regrets, **Resource Groups** serve as a logical grouping mechanism that allows users to access and manage underlying resources, such as accounts. Resource Groups also play a critical role in aggregating usage data for billing and reporting purposes.

## Key Features of Resource Groups

1. **Access Control**: Users are granted access to resources (e.g., accounts) through their association with a Resource Group. This ensures secure and organized access management.
2. **Usage Aggregation**: All resource usage within a Resource Group is rolled up, providing a consolidated view for billing and reporting.
3. **Scalability**: Resource Groups can accommodate a wide range of resources, making them suitable for both small teams and large organizations.
4. **Customizable Permissions**: Administrators can define specific permissions for users within a Resource Group, ensuring that access is tailored to their roles.

## How Resource Groups Work

1. **Resource Assignment**: Resources such as accounts are assigned to a Resource Group.
2. **User Association**: Users are granted access to a Resource Group, which automatically provides access to the resources within it.
3. **Usage Tracking**: The platform tracks resource usage at the Resource Group level, enabling accurate billing and reporting.

## Benefits of Resource Groups

- **Simplified Management**: Grouping resources simplifies access control and usage tracking.
- **Enhanced Security**: Logical grouping ensures that access is granted only to authorized users.
- **Transparent Billing**: Aggregated usage data provides clarity and transparency in billing.

## Managing Resource Groups

Administrators can manage Resource Groups through the Money Regrets dashboard, which provides tools for:

- Creating and deleting Resource Groups.
- Assigning resources to Resource Groups.
- Granting and revoking user access to Resource Groups.
- Monitoring usage and generating reports at the Resource Group level.

Resource Groups in Money Regrets ensure efficient and secure management of resources, while providing a clear and transparent view of usage and costs.
