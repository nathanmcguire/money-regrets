# Welcome to Money Regrets 💸

Welcome to **Money Regrets** – the personal finance app that doesn’t sugarcoat your spending habits. It’s not here to help you feel better. It’s here to hold up a mirror… and maybe laugh a little.


## 🧾 Taglines
- Financial literacy through emotional damage.
- All your worst purchases. In one place.
- Where your money goes to haunt you.
- Budgeting, but with consequences.


## 🎯 What Is This?

MoneyRegrets is a brutally honest, slightly sarcastic finance tracker designed to highlight your spending *sins*. Think of it as a budgeting app with a passive-aggressive therapist baked in.


## 📉 Core Features

- **Impulse Meter™**  
  Ranks your purchases by “Was this dumb?”

- **That Cost *What*? Popups**  
  Auto-roasts any high-dollar transactions in real-time.

- **Guilt Points**  
  Earn points for not spending money. Redeem for absolutely nothing.

- **Regret Timeline**  
  A visual journey of your financial decisions and the pain they caused.

- **Bank Integration**  
  Seamlessly connect your accounts using **Plaid**, **Finicity**, and **MX** to automatically track and categorize your spending.

- **Real-Time Syncing**  
  Stay up-to-date with your financial data across all connected accounts.
