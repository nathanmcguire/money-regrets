# Debits and Credits

Debits and Credits are neither good nore bad.

Debits and Credits are not the same as adding or subtracting

Debits and Credits are words used to reflect the duality or double-sided nature of all financial transactions.

Money flows from one account into another.

Accounts consider every transaction to involve a flow of economic beneifit from a source to a destination.

Economic benefit is the potential for an asset to contribute either directly or indirectly to the flow of an entity's cash.

Credits represent the source - owner's equity, liabilities, revenue

Debits represent the destination - assets, expenses, dividends

Assets = Liabilities + Equity

Equity = Owner's Equity - Dividends + Retained Earnings

Retained Earnings = Revenue - Expenses

Dividends + Expenses + Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity + Revenue
Debits = Credits

Debits - increase when debited and decrease when credited

Credits - increase when credited and decrease when debited
