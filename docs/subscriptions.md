# Subscriptions in Money Regrets

In Money Regrets, subscriptions are designed to provide flexibility and scalability by billing tenants based on their resource usage. This ensures that tenants only pay for what they use, making the platform cost-effective and adaptable to their needs.

## Key Features of Subscriptions

1. **Usage-Based Billing**: Subscriptions are calculated based on the resources consumed by the tenant, such as the number of transactions, storage usage, or API calls.
2. **Tenant-Level Payments**: All subscription charges are consolidated and billed at the tenant level, simplifying payment management for organizations.
3. **Scalability**: As tenants grow and their resource usage increases, the subscription model scales with them, ensuring uninterrupted access to the platform.
4. **Transparent Invoicing**: Detailed invoices are provided, outlining the resources consumed and the corresponding charges.

## How Subscriptions Work

1. **Resource Tracking**: The platform continuously monitors resource usage for each tenant.
2. **Billing Cycle**: At the end of each billing cycle (e.g., monthly), the total resource usage is calculated, and an invoice is generated.
3. **Payment**: Tenants can pay their subscription charges through various payment methods supported by the platform.

## Benefits of Usage-Based Subscriptions

- **Cost Efficiency**: Tenants only pay for the resources they use, avoiding unnecessary expenses.
- **Flexibility**: The model accommodates tenants of all sizes, from small businesses to large organizations.
- **Predictability**: Transparent invoicing ensures tenants understand their charges and can plan their budgets accordingly.

## Managing Subscriptions

Tenants can manage their subscriptions through the Money Regrets dashboard, which provides tools for:

- Viewing resource usage and billing history.
- Updating payment methods.
- Configuring usage alerts to avoid unexpected charges.

Money Regrets' subscription model ensures a fair and transparent billing process, empowering tenants to make the most of the platform while maintaining control over their costs.
