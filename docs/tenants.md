# Tenants in Money Regrets

In the context of Money Regrets, a SaaS platform, a **tenant** represents an organization or group of users that share access to the platform's features and resources. Each tenant is logically isolated from others, ensuring data security and privacy while leveraging shared infrastructure.

## Key Features of Tenants in Money Regrets

1. **Data Isolation**: Each tenant's data is stored and managed separately, ensuring that no tenant can access another's information.
2. **Customizable Settings**: Tenants can configure their own preferences, such as user roles, permissions, and notification settings.
3. **Multi-Tenancy Architecture**: Money Regrets uses a multi-tenant architecture, allowing multiple tenants to share the same infrastructure while maintaining logical separation.
4. **Scalability**: The platform dynamically allocates resources to tenants based on their usage and subscription plans.

## Examples of Tenants

- A small business using Money Regrets to track expenses and manage budgets.
- A non-profit organization leveraging the platform to monitor donations and spending.
- An individual user managing personal finances and setting financial goals.
